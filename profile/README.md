## Hi there 👋

You can customize your organization's Overview page to show a README and pinned repositories dedicated to public users or members of the organization.

Members of your organization who are signed into GitHub, can select a member or public view of the README and pinned repositories when they visit your organization's profile page.

The view defaults to member if either a members-only README or members-only pinned repositories are present, and public otherwise.

Users who are not members of your organization will be shown a public view.

The content of public README.md will appear on your organization's public profile.

- If your organization does not already have a public .github repository, create a public .github repository.
- In your organization's .github repository, create a README.md file in the profile folder.
- Commit the changes to the README.md file.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
